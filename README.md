# Data Lakehouse with Kubernetes and Data Warehousing

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a data lakehouse architecture using Kubernetes, Amazon S3, Apache Spark, and a data warehousing solution like Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery.
The architecture combines the scalability of a data lake with the performance of a data warehouse, enabling efficient data ingestion, processing, storage, and analysis.

## Project Components

1. **Amazon S3**: Scalable storage for raw and processed data.
2. **Kubernetes Cluster**: Container orchestration for scalable data processing.
3. **Apache Spark**: Distributed data processing engine.
4. **Amazon Redshift / Google BigQuery**: Data warehouse for fast querying and analytics.
5. **Apache Airflow**: Workflow orchestration for data loading.
6. **BI Tools (Tableau, Power BI, Looker)**: Data visualization and reporting.

## Steps to Implement

### 1. Set Up the Infrastructure

- **Amazon S3**: Create S3 buckets for raw and processed data.
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Set up a Kubernetes cluster using Amazon EKS or another cloud providerâ€™s Kubernetes service.
- **Data Warehouse**: Set up Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery.

### 2. Data Ingestion

- Use an ingestion tool (e.g., Apache Kafka, Apache Nifi, or custom applications) to ingest data from various sources into S3.
- Store raw data in a designated S3 bucket/prefix.

### 3. Data Processing with Kubernetes and Spark

- Deploy Apache Spark on your Kubernetes cluster.
- Use Spark jobs to transform raw data into refined, structured datasets.
- Store processed data back into S3 in a separate bucket/prefix.

### 4. Loading Data into Data Warehouse

- Deploy Apache Airflow on Kubernetes.
- Create workflows to periodically load processed data from S3 into your data warehouse.

### 5. Data Analysis and Visualization

- Use Amazon Athena to query processed data stored in S3.
- Connect BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker to your data warehouse.
- Implement dashboards and reports to analyze key metrics.

### 6. Security and Compliance

- Set up IAM roles, bucket policies, and encryption for securing data at rest and in transit.
- Implement monitoring and logging for auditing and compliance using tools like AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Grafana.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with permissions to create and manage S3, EKS, Redshift, IAM, and other related services.
- Kubernetes knowledge and experience with kubectl.
- Basic understanding of Apache Spark and Apache Airflow.
- Familiarity with SQL and data warehousing concepts.
